So we've put together some best practices on how to chat and meet, online and offline.  For those under 18, we strongly recommnd that you only chat and meet with people within your age group, people you already know or with whom you have established a trusted online friendship where that person's identity has been verified by other friends.  ** Safety Tips for Meeting Offline **  There is no substitute for acting with caution when communication with a stranger. You are in control of your online experience at all times - remain anonymous until you feel ready and confident that the person you've been chatting with is safe to meet. Remember to always trust your instincts. If you feel unsafe or threatened, cease communication and report any misbehavior immediately by emailing joenewbry@gmail.com.  * Guard your identity * Do not post personal contact information in your profile or username. Don't share your real name, personal phone numbers, email address, home address, place of work or any other identifying information until you have established a reasonable level of trust with the other party.  * Remain ananymous until you feel comfortable * Take advantage of the member-to-member technology utilized on Wingman services that protects your identity until YOU choose to reveal it. Wingman does not reveal your email address to other members ever. Wingman reveals your phone number only when you decide to share it with other members.  *Get to know the other person online before meeting them offline* Use the tools available through Wingman that protect your anonymity to get to know someone before meeting them in person. If you would like more information about someone, we recommend using the Internet and government resources available to everyone.  *Block and/or report abusive users* Block any member who behaves or treats you in an abusive way and report the behaivor to Wingman immediately. Call law enforcement if you feel threatened. Stop communication immediatley with anyone who pressures you for personal or financial information. Your involvement will help keep the community fun and enjoyable.</string>

When you hit it off with someone new, it's exciting to meet in person for the first time, but a little common sense goes a long way. Be smart and take some basic precautions:  * Always meet in public * Meet for the first time in a populated, public location - never in a private or remote location. No walks on the beach, as romantic as that might sound.  * Tell a friend * Inform a friend or family member of your plans and when and where you're going. Be reachable and take your phone with you.  * Stay sober * Do not do anything that would impair your judgement and cause you to make a decision you could regret.  * Find your own transportation to the first meeting * Just in case things don't work out, you need to be in control of your own ride - whether that means driving yourself or taking a taxi.  * Don't leave personal items unattended * You don't want to risk having your personal information stolen. If you're drinking, keep your drink with you at all times so it can't be tampered with.  * Stay in a public place * It is best not to go back to your date's home or bring them back to yours on the first date. If your date pressures you, end the date and leave at once.  * Sex without consent is rape * Always ask for permission and respect boundaries. No means no. When it comes to sex err on the side of caution.  * Sex with an underage person is rape * It does not matter if that person lied about their age. It's rape and you will go to prison.  </string>

So we've put together some best practices on how to chat and meet, online and offline.  For those under 18, we strongly recommnd that you only chat and meet with people within your age group, people you already know or with whom you have established a trusted online friendship where that person's identity has been verified by other friends.  ** Safety Tips for Meeting Offline **  There is no substitute for acting with caution when communication with a stranger. You are in control of your online experience at all times - remain anonymous until you feel ready and confident that the person you've been chatting with is safe to meet. Remember to always trust your instincts. If you feel unsafe or threatened, cease communication and report any misbehavior immediately by emailing joenewbry@gmail.com.  * Guard your identity * Do not post personal contact information in your profile or username. Don't share your real name, personal phone numbers, email address, home address, place of work or any other identifying information until you have established a reasonable level of trust with the other party.  * Remain ananymous until you feel comfortable * Take advantage of the member-to-member technology utilized on Wingman services that protects your identity until YOU choose to reveal it. Wingman does not reveal your email address to other members ever.

When you hit it off with someone new, it's exciting to meet in person for the first time, but a little common sense goes a long way. Be smart and take some basic precautions:  * Always meet in public * Meet for the first time in a populated, public location - never in a private or remote location. No walks on the beach, as romantic as that might sound.  * Tell a friend * Inform a friend or family member of your plans and when and where you're going. Be reachable and take your phone with you.  * Stay sober * Do not do anything that would impair your judgement and cause you to make a decision you could regret.  * Find your own transportation to the first meeting * Just in case things don't work out, you need to be in control of your own ride - whether that means driving yourself or taking a taxi.  * Don't leave personal items unattended * You don't want to risk having your personal information stolen. If you're drinking, keep your drink with you at all times so it can't be tampered with.  * Stay in a public place * It is best not to go back to your date's home or bring them back to yours on the first date. If your date pressures you, end the date and leave at once.  * Sex without consent is rape * Always ask for permission and respect boundaries. No means no. When it comes to sex err on the side of caution.  * Sex with an underage person is rape * It does not matter if that person lied about their age. It's rape and you will go to prison.  </string>

*** Terms of Use ***
Terms Of Use
Please read these Terms of Use carefully, which include and hereby incorporate the Privacy Policy and Acceptable Use Policy (collectively, the "Terms"). Wingman provides a service that allows Account holders to create unique personal profiles and communicate with other members based on location. These Terms govern and apply to your access and use of Wingman's social networking services available via Wingman's mobile apps (Wingman, Flurv and Boyahoy) (collectively, the "Apps") and Wingman's websites (www.wingman.com) (collectively, the "Sites"). To make these Terms easier to read, the Sites, our services and the Apps are collectively called the "Services."
This document constitutes a legally binding agreement between you and Wingman, Inc. ("Wingman") The Service(s) are not intended for use by children under 13 years of age.
** Agreement to Terms **
By accessing or using our Services, you agree that (1) you are age 13 or older, (2) you understand and agree to these Terms, and (3) if you are between the ages of 13 and 18, your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these Terms.
IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE. USE OF THE SERVICE IS VOID WHERE PROHIBITED.
** Changes to Terms or Services **
We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we'll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It's important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are agreeing to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you can't use the Services anymore. If you object to any change or modification, your sole recourse shall be to cease using the Services. YOU AGREE THAT SKOUT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY CHANGE OR MODIFICATION TO THESE TERMS. Except as may be expressly specified otherwise by Wingman with respect to paid portions of the Services, we reserve the right to add, change, suspend or discontinue the Services, or any aspect or feature of the Services, without notice or liability.
** Who May Use the Services **
You may use the Services only if you are 13 years or older and are not prohibited from using the Services under applicable law or under any provision of these Terms. Additional eligibility requirements are as follows.
* Eligibility on Wingman - Adult Community *
You must be at least 18 years old to use the Wingman Adult Site or to register for the Services. By using the Adult Site, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old. If you're between the ages of 13-17, you may use Wingman for Teens.
* Eligibility on Wingman - Teen Community *
You must be at least 13 years old or older to use the Wingman Teen Site or to register for the Services. By using the Teen Site, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years old. Please note that if you register for Wingman for Teens, when you turn 18 you will automatically be migrated to the Wingman Adult Site and your minor friends will be lost.
If you're younger than 13, go outside and play!
* Eligibility on Wingman - Criminal History and Background Checks of Users *
By requesting to use, registering to use, and/or using the Adult or Teen Wingman Service, you represent and warrant that you have never been convicted of a felony and/or are not required to register as a sex offender with any government entity. Wingman DOES NOT CURRENTLY CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SCREENINGS ON ITS MEMBERS. However, Wingman reserves the right to conduct any criminal background check, at any time and using available public records, to confirm your compliance with your representations and warrants above. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU HEREBY AUTHORIZE ANY SUCH CHECK.
** Privacy Policy **
Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information on how we collect, use and disclose information, including personal information, from our users.
** Creating a Wingman Account **
To access and use the Services, you will need to register and create an account (your "Account"). You can do this by providing an email address and password or through your account with Facebook. When creating an Account, you will be required to provide certain personal information about yourself, including your age. If you choose to register your Account using your Facebook account, we will extract certain personal information from your Facebook account, such as your name, age, email address and other personal information that your privacy settings on your Facebook account permit us to access. Only users who are 18 or older may register an Account on BoyAhoy.
It's important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account, and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. Because Wingman maintains separate communities for users who are between the ages of 13 and 17 and users who are 18 and older, it is especially important that you are truthful when identifying your age. Your profile may be deleted, and your Account may be terminated without warning, if we believe that you are under 13 years of age, if you represent yourself as under the age of 18 and we believe that you have misrepresented your age, or if we believe you are over 18 and represent yourself as under 18.
You agree that you won't disclose your Account password to anyone and you'll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.
** Content and Content Rights **
For purposes of these Terms: "Content" means text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, works of authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available through the Services; and "User Content" means any Content that Account holders (including you) provide to be made available through the Services. Accordingly, Content includes but is not limited to User Content.
* Content Ownership, Responsibility and Removal *
Wingman does not claim any ownership rights in any Content that you make available through the Services and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit your User Content. Subject to the foregoing, Wingman and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services and Content, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Services and Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services or Content.
* Rights in User Content Granted by You *
By making any User Content available through Services you hereby grant to Wingman a perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicenseable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform and distribute your User Content in connection with operating and providing the Services and Content to you and to other Account holders.
You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that you own all your User Content or you have all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You also represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Services, nor any use of your User Content by Wingman on or through the Services will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's intellectual property rights, rights of publicity or privacy, or any other rights or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.
You can remove your User Content by specifically deleting it from your profile. However, in certain instances, some of your User Content (such as virtual gifts you give or chat messages you send) may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue to exist on the Services. We are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User Content.
* Rights in Content Granted by Wingman *
Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Wingman grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to download, view, copy, display and print the Content solely in connection with your permitted use of the Services and solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes.
** Virtual Items; Wingman Points **
You may obtain points through the Apps ("Wingman Points") or other virtual items by engaging in certain actions (for example, by downloading third party apps) or purchasing them for the amounts set forth in the Apps. Wingman Points and such other virtual items are referred to collectively as "Virtual Items." Virtual Items are digital items only, and regardless of the terminology used, have no cash value and may never be redeemed for "real world" money. Your right to use any Virtual Items that you obtain is limited to a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, revocable right to use such Wingman Points or other Virtual Items solely within the Apps, for example, to send "gifts" to other users, save pictures or use the "checked me out" functionality. Except for the limited rights described herein, you have no property interest or right or title in or to any Virtual Items, which remain the exclusive property of Wingman. The scope, variety and type of Virtual Items that you may obtain can change at any time. Wingman has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate such Virtual Items as it sees fit in its sole discretion, and Wingman will have no liability to you or any third party for the exercise of such rights at any time.
Except where explicitly authorized within the Services, (i) transfers of Virtual Items between you and Account holders or third parties are strictly prohibited; (ii) outside of the Services, you may not buy or sell any Virtual Items for "real world" money or otherwise exchange items for value; and (iii) Wingman does not recognize any such purported transfers of Virtual Items, nor the purported sale, gift or trade in the "real world" of anything that appears in the Services. Any attempt to do any of the foregoing is a violation of these Terms and will result in an automatic termination of your rights to use the Virtual Items and may result in termination of your Account, a lifetime ban from the Service and/or possible legal action. All Virtual Items are forfeited if your Account is terminated or suspended for any reason, in Wingman's sole and absolute discretion, or if Wingman discontinues providing the Services or Virtual Items.
** Acceptable Use Policy, Rules and Restrictions and Our Enforcement Rights **

** Warranty Disclaimers **
THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding the Services, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.
You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Wingman's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Wingman may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
Any notices or other communications provided by Wingman under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) by Wingman via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
Wingman's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Wingman. As used in these Terms, the word "including" means "including but not limited to." Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
